# **Forged Iron Paths**

## Summary

Step into the shoes of Mauritian maroons fighting for freedom. Explore forests, discover hidden grottoes, and make choices that shape the fate of a rebellion. Every decision counts… which path will you forge?

If you want, I can also **draft the GitHub folder structure and push commands** for this game jam project so it’s ready to slot into your `questforcode` repo just like your RPA mini projects — organized, clean, and portfolio-ready.

Do you want me to do that next?
